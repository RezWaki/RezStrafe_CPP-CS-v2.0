# RezStrafe_CPP-CS-v2.0
New version of RezStrafe_CPP-CS based on latest RezStrafe_CPP (v9.0 for now)

A little bit rewritten strafing algorythm

Plz make sure you using 1280x1024 screen resolution & 800x600 CS resolution, for that time RSCPPCS have some major bugs connected with screen resolution, (256 (128^2) is distance between upper left screen corner (0, 0) & CS window position (center screen, if 1280x1024 then 1280/2 & 1024/2), at different resolutions this distance will be differs, if your screen resolution > 1280x1024 that distance for example may be 512, 256 distance is written in algorythm, so be sure your resolution is 1280x1024)
